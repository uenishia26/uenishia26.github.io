        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <h2>I'm Anamu Uenishi</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I’m Anamu Uenishi, a junior at Boston University majoring in Computer Science. I’m passionate about AI, especially with technologies like the combination of OCR and AI to automate financial data processes. I love streamlining operations and replacing manual data entry with smarter, more efficient systems.</p>
        <p>This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Family First Clinic, where I developed machine learning models to predict patient no-shows. Seeing how these models actually reduced no-shows and boosted clinic productivity was pretty awesome. I’ve also played around with low-level systems, building automation pipelines with GNUPlot to find scientific data anomalies, but honestly, machine learning and neural networks are where I thrive. Right now, I’m co-authoring my first research paper on imbalanced datasets in ML—hopefully, it’ll be published later this month!</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, you can probably catch me at the pool playing water polo with BU’s team or prepping for my next Ironman race. And if I’m not working out, I’m likely out surfing, scuba diving, or off on some new travel adventure.</p>
