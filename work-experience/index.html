        <h3>Family First Clinic</h3>
        <p><strong>May 2024 - Sep 2024 · 5 months</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States · Remote</p>
        
        <h4>Role and Achievements:</h4>
        <p>As a Machine Learning Project Lead, I spearheaded the development of a logistic regression model to predict patient no-show probabilities, aiming to enhance patient attendance and improve the clinic’s overall efficiency. Over the course of this work, I meticulously analyzed and preprocessed over 10,000 patient records spanning 8 years. This extensive dataset allowed me to identify key factors influencing no-show rates, such as appointment times, patient demographics, and historical attendance patterns, ultimately improving the model's accuracy by 40%.</p>
        
        <p>To ensure the model achieved optimal performance, I refined it through hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization. I validated its accuracy and robustness with cross-validation techniques, which provided a thorough assessment of its predictive capabilities. In addition, I implemented an automated email reminder system to notify patients of their upcoming appointments, effectively reducing the likelihood of no-shows.</p>

        <p>The combined efforts of the predictive model and the reminder system led to a 15% reduction in missed appointments. This significant improvement in scheduling efficiency directly contributed to a 2-4% increase in the clinic's quarterly revenue.</p>
